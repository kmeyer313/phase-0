# Die Class 1: Numeric

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ]

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# 0. Pseudocode

# Input:
# Output: random number
# Steps:
Create a new class
initialize for number of sides
Define method for sides? or if not if initialized?
Define method for roll (to be a random number)
Raise an error if < 1

# 1. Initial Solution

class Die
  def initialize(sides)
    # code goes here
  end

  def sides
    # code goes here
  end

  def roll
    # code goes here
  end
end
