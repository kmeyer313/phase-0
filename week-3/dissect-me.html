          Version control is a management system that helps keep track of the changes you make on your work as a developer. It allows developers to keep track of their work and communicate/collaborate with their teams on larger projects.

          Git is a popular version control software that is used locally on the computer. Because it is local, a developer can access without the internet and push it to a centralized repository when ready. It keeps track of changes if the developer makes commits throughout their work, as long as the activity that warrents untracked status.

          GitHub is a popular environment on the internet where developers are able to collaborate remotely on a project. For public repositories, developers can share, contribute to, give feedback, and learn from each others' code.

1) What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
- The "must haves" that we made a snippet of in Sublime give the bare bones structure of the html page: <!DOCTYPE html> <html></html> <head></head> <meta charset="UTF-8"> <title></title> <body></body>
- Headline tags <h1></h1> are important for determining the hierarchy of information across the page.
- Paragraph tags <p></p> are used pretty frequently for including content.
- Other tags that we used for this challenge, but I am eager to use more often as I have learned more about the new HTML5 structural elements, were <header></header> to distinguish the title information of the blog and <article></article> to hold the paragraphs about the content of the blog. We didn't have much else in this first blog post to use tags such as <section></section>, <aside></aside>, <nav></nav>, or <footer></footer>.

2) How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
- Using Chrome's Dev Tools to inspect the page we created was really helpful in helping me clean up my organization and indenting. It makes a lot of sense the way the inspector organizes the information. Without opening the groups, the inspector shows that at its base, the page has <!DOCTYPE html> <html></html> <head></head> <body></body>. This makes so much sense! You can open the <head> and the <body> to see what is inside. From using this and comparing it to what I originally had, I learned that the <main></main> nested in the body around the content I have. I wonder what other element would be of the same hierarchy as <main> since at the moment it seems to be acting like <body>, there must be something else on that level to go within the body, the <footer>? For the <body> it was helpful to see how to organize it cleanly so that it flows from <body> to <main> to <header> to <article>, the last two elements containing further content. It is quite amazing and even includes my comments! So cool!

3) What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
- We learned how to make a shortcut, code snippet, that could be accessed by typing the name of the snippet (in this case html5). SUPER! I love this little trick and definitely can't wait to use it again! I also need to do some research about shortcuts that exist. Often when I type, I notice suggestions appearing, but I haven't taken the time to figure out how to use that yet!
