  Reflection for 2.6 Pair Challenge
  - What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was pretty exciting to apply what I had just learned and see the results so quickly.

  - How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  The resources for HTML elements were pretty useful. I do think I need to do some research about spacing to feel more adept.

  - How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I appreciate not thinking about formatting because that can get distracting. I think it is important to arrange the content by hierarchy first before getting fancy.

  - What seems good and bad about HTML?
  I like that it is simple enough to get your started with the bare bones of a website. I am okay that it cannot do styling as CSS does because it helps me focus on one thing at a time.

  - What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I liked using the "Skillcrush HTML Tag Cheatsheet." It has a simple format and I can quickly access the most common tags until they have become automatic. When we started the html page, my pair recommended that we first type all the "must haves" opening and closing tags. This was a good habit for me to begin. Other than writing the closing tag right away, I haven't really come up with other tricks.
