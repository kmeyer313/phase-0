# Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
To create a repository, go to your profile on GitHub and click the + button at the top right corner of the page. Choose "New repository." To clone it to your computer, click the "Fork" button at the top right.Then scroll down on the right side of the page to find the URL. Copy the URL and then go to the Terminal (the command line). Navigate to the directory (folder) that you want to nest it in. Then type "git clone URL".

# Describe what open source means.
Open source means that work (software or code) is available to others to build on and share their work.


# What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
It's pretty cool that people want to collaborate and share their work. I wonder what motivations drive people in this type of environment. Hope of profit? Sheer good-will? Laziness? For fun? I am grateful that people are willing to share as a newbie. I value learning things on my own, but can imagine a day when I would rather not reinvent the wheel. There are a lot of smart people out there that are lightyears me! I have a hard time believing that I have anything to add/contribute to this world of code. It seems like everything will have been done before by the time I am proficient enough to make beautiful and meaningful things.

# Assess the importance of using licenses.
It is news to me that there are a few specific, different types of licenses that are important to know. But after getting a sense of the differences, the need for this makes sense.

# What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The commit and push flow sunk in with this activity. I feel that I have a good enough understanding of how to make a commit and felt more confident as I worked through that. It just flowed and my "aha" was simply that I saw how quickly and effiently it worked. What took me hours to grasp before I was able to complete in minutes. I am also navigating my way in the CLI more automatically, although I still need to figure out how to rename a directory with "rm". I also struggle with opening a file in Sublime from the CLI.

# Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list.
I tried to find how to rename a directory from the command line (as I have not yet done this successfully after the first time). What I found says the same thing I already tried: mv old_name new_name. I'll have to try this again another time.
