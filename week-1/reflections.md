# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
All of these ideas have been crossing my path over the past few years and I am thrilled that they are valued here. I'm ready to delve into this! There is not really one that stands above the rest for me, I am a jack of all trades, master of known. In the same way I like a little bit of all of these and will work on developing tiny habits, mindfulness, and use of the Pomodoro technique.

I like the idea of Time Boxing, similar to the Pomodoro technique, and I am implementing it now (although I am giving myself 25 minutes instead of the suggested 10, because I'll probably want it). I tend to take too much unfocused time to do things. At other times I get lost in the "flow" and don't need to come up for air for hours, but I think the Pomodoro/Time Boxing idea is smart in that there is a built in recap, evaluation, and reflection (a time that also may be good to insert a pushup/meditation/bathroom/water/stretch break). I think Time Boxing for will be a valuable process for working with pairs and for solo work. It is so easy to get distracted, but by setting an end time and committing to working hard through that time will work for me. When I don't have an end time, that's when I start checking Facebook and the like... Stopping at the end of the time frame and reviewing what was accomplished will motivate me and help me more deeply understand what I am doing.

My current strategies are considered counter-intuitive in the link Counter-Intuitive Productivity, "Seasons and Cycles Over Steady-State Roboticism" and "Flow before Patterns." Though I didn't know they were a thing, this is what I seem to default to. However, I never embraced these ideas because I never really read anything so affirming! Instead, I tried to fit the mold and imitate my seemingly super productive peers. That didn't work out too well for me. Now, I will be embracing these ideas with greater intention. Coupled with the Pomodoro/Time Boxing ideas and developing tiny habits, I think tackling challenges and doing things I don't really want to do, but have to, will be great strategies for me going forward!

So my timer is at 30 minutes. In the Pomodoro Technique step 3 it says, "make accurate estimations of how many pomodoros I need for a certain activity." I'm not surprised, but I underestimated how long it would take me to do this. Story of my life. This is an area I would like to improve in -- estimating how much time it will take me to do something -- I always underestimate! Okay, timer is at 34 minutes. Stopping now.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
The shell is the command line interpreter where a user can efficiently navigate and perform more complex tasks within the raw computer, unlike the common user-friendly navigation tool Finder (for Macs). Bash is the shell we are using. There are other shells, but Bash is commonly used.

For me, the most challenging parts of this material was grasping push/pop, pipes and redirection. I need to take some time to develop my understanding for these concepts. I was also a little thrown in deciphering the results of apropos!

The commands for navigating around the directories seem foundational for more complex navigation and tasks. I think pipes and redirection commands will become more important as the basics are harnessed. Personally, the wildcard, find, and grep commands are most exciting to me at the moment because I can think of times I've tried to find a file that I can't remember the name of.

pwd = print working directory (shows you what directory you are working in)

ls = list directory (list the files and directories that are in the current directory)

mv = renaming a file or directory (this confuses me as it states in the book that mv means move directory, aren't rename and move two different things?)

cp = to copy a file or directory

cd = change directories

../ = move up one directory

touch = create a new file (that is empty)

mkdir = make a new directory

grep = to find things inside a file, ie. grep squirrels *.txt would print all the instances that squirrels comes up in every .txt file

less = to scan through a page of text in a file

rmdir = remove directory

rm = remove file

help --> for Mac users, the commands are man = takes you to a manual page and apropos = to help find an appropriate manual for what you are looking for

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection
To create a new repo, click the plus button on the top right of your GitHub and select "New Repository." To fork a repository, click "Fork" on the upper right hand side of the page. This will create a repository of it into your own account. To clone the repo in your account to your computer, you need to scroll down to the URL near the bottom right hand side of the page and copy it. Then go to the terminal, navigate to the directory you want to store it in, and enter git clone URL. Forking a repository and creating a new one do different things. Forking  a repo copies the master repo so that you are able to edit and make additions/deletions without changing the original master. Eventually it will be merged back into the master, but it is more efficient and practical for developers to fork off and do work separate from the master. Creating a new repository would be starting from scratch!

I didn't have trouble setting up git and GitHub, but I had a problem when I went to work in the command line. It was the first time I experienced the overwhelm of having no idea what to do. I tried to figure out the solution by Googling and then reached out on Slack. A cohort mate asked me some questions that led me to solving the problem. I felt so grateful! The fear and shock of having no idea what to do was really numbing! I was surprised by how helpless I felt and it caused me to think over the suggestions DBC made for embracing the confusion, researching, and exposing ignorance. A preview of the many of these times more to come... :)
